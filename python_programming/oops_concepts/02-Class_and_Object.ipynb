    "\n",
    "1. `__class__`:\n",
    "   - This method returns the class of an instance. For example, `instance.__class__` returns the class type of `instance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `__delattr__(self, name)`:\n",
    "   - This method is called when an attribute deletion is attempted using the `del` statement. It allows you to customize attribute deletion behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `__dict__`:\n",
    "   - This attribute is a dictionary containing the object's attributes and their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `__dir__`:\n",
    "   - This method is called when the `dir()` function is used on an object. It should return a list of attributes and methods available on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `__doc__`:\n",
    "   - This attribute holds the docstring (documentation string) for the class or module.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `__eq__(self, other)`:\n",
    "   - This method is called when the equality operator (`==`) is used to compare two objects. It allows you to define custom equality logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `__format__(self, format_spec)`:\n",
    "   - This method is called by the `format()` function to format the object using a specified format.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `__ge__(self, other)`, `__gt__(self, other)`, `__le__(self, other)`, `__lt__(self, other)`:\n",
    "   - These methods define the behavior of comparison operators (`>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`) when used to compare two objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `__getattribute__(self, name)`:\n",
    "   - This method is called when an attribute is accessed using dot notation. It allows you to customize attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `__hash__(self)`:\n",
    "    - This method returns a hash value for the object. It is used when the object is used as a key in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `__init__(self[, ...])`:\n",
    "    - This is the constructor method, called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. `__init_subclass__(cls[, ...])`:\n",
    "    - This method is called when a subclass of the class is created. It allows you to customize the behavior of subclass creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. `__ne__(self, other)`:\n",

    "    - This method is called before `__init__` when creating a new instance of the class. It's responsible for creating and returning a new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. `__reduce__(self)` and `__reduce_ex__(self)`:\n",
    "    - These methods are used for pickling and unpickling objects. They define how an object should be serialized and deserialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. `__repr__(self)`:\n",
    "    - This method returns a string representation of the object, typically used for debugging and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. `__setattr__(self, name, value)`:\n",
    "    - This method is called when an attribute is set using the assignment operator (`=`). It allows you to customize attribute assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. `__sizeof__(self)`:\n",
    "    - This method returns the size of the object in memory, in bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. `__str__(self)`:\n",
    "    - This method returns a human-readable string representation of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. `__subclasshook__(cls, C)`:\n",
    "    - This method is used to customize class inheritance checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. `__weakref__`:\n",
    "    - This attribute is used to implement weak references to the object. It's automatically created for objects that support weak references.\n",

By implementing these methods, you can control how your objects are compared, displayed, serialized, and interacted with in different ways."
