    "\n",
    "**Data Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction is the simplest form of abstraction. When working with OOPS, you primarily work on manipulating and dealing with complex objects. This object represents some data but the underlying characteristics or structure of that data is actually hidden from you. Letâ€™s go back to our example of making coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s say that I need a special hazelnut coffee this time. Luckily, thereâ€™s a new type of coffee powder or processed coffee beans that already have hazelnut in it. So I can directly add the hazelnut coffee beans and the coffee machine treats it as just any other regular coffee bean. In this case, the hazelnut coffee bean itself is an abstraction of the original data, the raw coffee beans. I can use the hazelnut coffee beans directly without worrying about how the original coffee beans were made to add the hazelnut flavour to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, data abstraction refers to hiding the original data entity via a data structure that can internally work through the hidden data entities. As programmers, we donâ€™t need to know what the underlying entity is, how it looks etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where data abstraction works with data, process abstraction does the same job but with processes. In process abstraction, the underlying implementation details of a process are hidden. We work with abstracted processes that under the hood use hidden processes to execute an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circling back to our coffee example, letâ€™s say our coffee machine has a function to internally clean the entire empty machine for us. This is a process that we may want to do every once a week or two so that our coffee machine stays clean. We press a button on the machine which sends it a command to internally clean it. Under the hood, there is a lot that will happen now. The coffee machine will need to clean the piston, the outlets or nozzles from which it pours the coffee, and the container for the beans, and then finally rinse out the water and dry out the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single process of cleaning the coffee machine was known to us, but internally it implements multiple other processes that were actually abstracted from us. This is process abstraction in a nutshell.\n",
    "\n",

    "A lot of times programmers often confuse abstraction with encapsulation because in reality the two concepts are quite intertwined and share a relationship between them. Abstraction, as weâ€™ve seen pertains to hiding underlying details and implementation in a program. Encapsulation, on the other hand, describes how abstraction occurs in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a design-level process but encapsulation is an implementation process. Encapsulation tells us how exactly you can implement abstraction in the program. Abstraction pertains to only displaying the essential details to the user whereas encapsulation pertains to typing up all the data members and associated member functions into a single abstracted unit."
